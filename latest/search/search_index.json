Overview video Click on the image bellow to see a short (~3 min) overview video. For a longer introduction please see tutorial videos. Getting started Installation Install Python and check that it is available on the command line by running: python --version It is recommended to use Python virtual environments to isolate different set of Python libraries. Create virtual environment for pyFlies by running: python -m venv pyflies-venv This will create folder pyflies-venv where your libraries will be installed. You need to activate virtual environment before usage: source pyflies-venv/bin/activate (for Linux and other POSIX systems) pyflies-venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat (for Windows) Now, you can install pyFlies and generator for PsychoPy with: pip install pyflies-psychopy To verify that pyFlies is installed you can run: textx list-generators You can see in the output that the generator pyflies -> psychopy is available. pyFlies specifications are pure text and can be edited by any textual editor but for a good experience (especially with tables) it is recommended that pyFlies extension for VS Code is used. Install VS Code either for you OS package manager or by going to VS Code download page and downloading package for your operating system. In the list of extensions find pyFlies and click on install . Note In order to run your experiments you need to install software for the target platform you want to generate code for (currently PsychoPy only). Note You can watch the process of installation in this video . In the video we are using Linux but most of the information is valid for other OSes. Video tutorials The best way to start with pyFlies is by watching some of our video tutorials . Try examples Clone or download pyFlies repo . Unpack and load examples from examples folder in the VS Code editor. Update experiment definition to your taste. Generate and run experiment. Planned features Besides language improvement which we are constantly work on, there are two bigger features that will greatly improve overall user experience in working in the pyFlies editor: Running generators from the context menu in VS Code and getting feedback and errors. \"Smart\" code-completion and code navigation. Currently, we provide only code snippets which can help a lot but implementing Language Server Protocol for pyFlies we can get much better editing experience. For example, when you type exec -> editor can offer just the components, or when you are inside the component parameters editor can offer just the parameters for that component (without those that are already specified) with explanation extracted from the component description in the tooltip. Furthermore, navigation will enable to click on a variable and jump to its definition. Discuss, ask questions For all questions, ideas, feature requests and bug report please use the GitHub issue tracker . Screenshots (click for a popup) Editing specification Experiment is created and modified in a convenient to use editor. Generated log From an experiment specification a full log of the experiment flow is generated which can be used to investigate and debug the experiment.

They are used to specify values of related variables given in a row representing a certain state. These tables are used in test defintion and for repeat with form of repetition. In the test definition each row of the table represent a single test trial. While in repeat with statement each row represent a single cycle through the repeat loop where the values of the variables will be from the corresponding table row. | number | parity | |--------------|----------| | numbers loop | parities | The header of the table contains variable names ( number and parity ) while the cells of the rest of the table contain expressions . Tables expansion Tables are usually, although not necessary, written in a compact form which is expanded during compilation. This compact representation is shorter, require less screen space and gives more flexibility in adding new variables and altering the number of conditions. Note Tables are written in pure text and can be edited with any text editor but for a convenience pyFlies VS Code editor has auto-formatting and navigation capabilities which makes editing much more pleasant. To understand table expansion lets look at some examples. Lets say we want to loop through several colors and for each color to loop through some directions to explore all possible options. We can do that in the following way: | color | direction | | ----------------------- | ------------------ | | [red, green, blue] loop | [left, right] loop | Expressions in both columns are loop expressions over list of symbols. Loop expressions are evaluated and nested from left to right, so the table in expanded form will be: | color | direction | | ----- | --------- | | red | left | | red | right | | green | left | | green | right | | blue | left | | blue | right | Tip Use log generator to produce expanded tables, and other interesting information about your experiment. Now, lets expand the table a bit. Lets suppose that we want a new table variable called congruency that has value congruent if color is green and incongruent otherwise. For this we can use if expression: | color | direction | congruency | | ----------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | | [red, green, blue] loop | [left, right] loop | congruent if color == green else incongruent | See how we referenced color variable in the congruency column and compared its value with the symbol green . Now, the expanded table will be: | color | direction | congruency | | ----- | --------- | ----------- | | red | left | incongruent | | red | right | incongruent | | green | left | congruent | | green | right | congruent | | blue | left | incongruent | | blue | right | incongruent | Tip To make table expressions simpler you can always define variables which can hold a used sequence or a whole expression. For example: colors = [red, green, blue] directions = [left, right] is_congruent = congruent if color == green else incongruent test MyTest { | index | color | direction | congruency | | ----- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | | 1..8 | colors loop | directions loop | is_congruent | } Now, lets say we want to introduce index variable which will be the number of the current row. In compact form it is easy: | index | color | direction | congruency | | ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | | 1..8 | [red, green, blue] loop | [left, right] loop | congruent if color == green else incongruent | Notice the use of the range type as the expression in the index column. If we have a sequence-like type (list or range) then the value will cycle, i.e. for each row the next value from the sequence will be used until the sequence is exhausted. After that the sequence will start from the beginning. So, we can say that loop expression take precedence. If the row has loop expressions they will be used, from left to right, to drive the row creation and other sequences will be fillers. If no loop exists in the row, sequences will expand until the longest is exhausted. Consider this example: | color | direction | | ------------------ | ------------- | | [red, green, blue] | [left, right] | Since we have no loops the table will expand to three rows, until the colors are exhausted while the direction will cycle: | color | direction | | ----- | --------- | | red | left | | green | right | | blue | left | In the previous example where we added index column with range 1..8 , we could easily specify larger range 1..100 and the result will be the same. That is because we have loops in the column and the index is just the filler so that after row 8 is created all loops are over and the expansion stops. We can specify multiple rows even in a compact form, and can mix and match constant rows with expression based. For example: | index | color | direction | | ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ | | 1..2 | [orange, brown] | up | | 3..100 | [red, green, blue] loop | [left, right] loop | will expand to: | index | color | direction | |-------|--------|-----------| | 1 | orange | up | | 2 | brown | up | | 3 | red | left | | 4 | red | right | | 5 | green | left | | 6 | green | right | | 7 | blue | left | So, the first row will expand and then the second. Now, you can see that creating table of conditions is easy and very powerful. Tip pyFlies provides CSV generator, which is a standard textX based generator like all others, that you can use to create condition table using pyFlies powerful syntax and table expansion and export it for use in other tools.","title":"Condition tables"},{"location":"condition-tables/#condition-tables","text":"Condition tables define one or more variables in each column and their values for conditions in each row.

Here is an example of how experiment flow may look like: flow { show Intro for 5000 execute Parity(practice true, random true) show Real // repeat test 2 times, each repetition will be randomized repeat 2 times Parity(random true) } Showing screens In the above example, we see that first the Intro screen is shown to the subject for 5s. for definition is optional and if not given screen will be displayed until the subject provide some input (keypress, mouse click etc.). We can pass arguments to screen which can be used to introduce variable parts in the screen content. For details see the screens section . Executing tests Each test definition may be executed many times during the course of the test. Test is executed with execute statement after which we give the name of the test and optionally argument values. execute is just an alias of repeat 1 time <test name> See the looping section for details on the repeat statement. Passing arguments to tests and screens As you may have notice in the above example, we may pass arguments to screens and tests. These arguments will be available as variables in the context of the test/screen. For example: execute Parity(practice true, random true, some_param 42) Argument can have any name and any value type. Two arguments of bool type have special meaning: practice and random . Default values of both those params are false . These params are applicable only to the test execution. If practice is set to true then the execution will not record any data. If random is set to true then the order of trials in the test will be randomized. Repeating A flow definition may contain repeat loops. The repeat loop can be specified for a single test execution or for a block of statements. repeat keyword define the looping statement. There are two form of repeat : repeat <x> times and repeat with . repeat <x> times This form of repeat is used to loop a test or a block of statements for the given number of times. Examples: repeat 5 times Posner(random true) repeat 3 times { screen Instructions for 10000 execute Posner } repeat blocks can be nested: repeat 3 times { screen Instructions for 10000 repeat 2 times { screen InnerBlockInstructions execute Posner } } repeat with This form of looping is used when we have a condition table and we want to execute a test or a block of statements for each row of the table. Variables from the table are available inside the looping block. Example: repeat { show instruction // 3 same blocks repeat 3 times { execute showImages show break for 1000 } } with | image_type | order | | ---------------- | ----- | | image_types loop | 1..2 | In this example we have a repeat with outer loop with a condition table given after the with keyword. image_types is a global variable defined, for example, as: image_types = [houses, faces] used here to expand the table . For each row of the table the block of statement will be executed and variables defined in the table ( image_type and order ) will be available inside the block. These variables will be propagated to all inner repeat loops and to all execution of tests and screens. This means that we can reference these two variables in the screen content and in the test expressions (e.g. component parameters in test definitions).

Each test has a name, a condition table defining variables and their values for each trial, and component specifications with mapping to trials. On this page we will use an example to show how tests are defined and we will provide references to other pages describing each segment of the definition in more details. Here is an example of a test: The example represents the definition of the Eriksen Flanker task published in: Eriksen, B. A.; Eriksen, C. W. (1974). \"Effects of noise letters upon identification of a target letter in a non- search task\". Perception and Psychophysics. 16: 143\u2013149. The target is flanked by non-target stimuli which correspond either to the same directional response as the target (congruent flankers), or to the opposite response (incongruent flankers). In this example we are using arrows which points to the left or to the right. The surrounding non-target stimuli will be congruent (point to the same direction), or incongruent (point to the opposite direction). Before the test we have three variables defined which we shall use in the test: directions - a list of directions, congruencies - a list of congruencies as each trial can be either congruent or inconguruent, and repeats - a number of repeats we shall use to change the total number of trials during the test run. Test table expansion Values of each trial variable is given as an expression in the table first non-header row. You can see that each expression is a loop expression which will loop over the given sequence to expand the table. Loops are evaluated from left to right, leftmost loop being the top-level outer loop while the rightmost loop being the inner loop. We could also have a sequence without the loop, in which case the sequence would cycle, or any other expression involving global and trail variables and literal values. For repeats value of 1 , as defined globally, this table expands as follow: We could as well write condition table in the expanded style but it would be less flexible as it would be harder to add new variables, to use repetition for total number of trials etc. For the details of condition table specification and expansion see Condition Tables section. Tip Although, pyFlies specifications are just plain textual files and can be edited in any text editor, it is much more convenient to edit tables in editor that supports them, like VS Code pyFlies extension . Components specification The second part of the test definition are mappings of components to trials. These mappings define the components (stimuli and inputs), their timings and conditions under which they should be shown to the subject. These mappings are given in the form: <condition> -> <list of components with timings> where left-hand side (LHS) <condition> is boolean expression which when evaluated to true in the context of the current trial means that the components on the right side are used in the trial. Trial phases For better organization, each trial execution is separated in three phases: fix , exec and error/correct . The phases are executed in succession and for each execution builtin boolean variables fix , exec , error , correct get value of true for corresponding phase, thus those variables can be used in LHS expressions to match the phase. In the above example we have fix -> cross.. . LHS condition is just fix variable which will be true during fix phase of each trial. Thus, cross component will be shown to the subject during each fix phase. If we wanted, for example, to show cross only for odd trials we could write: fix and parity == odd -> cross() for 1000 Notice the part of the definition for 1000 . Each component can optionally define its duration in miliseconds. Here we specify that the cross component will be shown for 1s. If duration is not provided it means indefinitely and the component will last until the end of the phase. We usually use indefinite durations when we have input components which terminate phases on user input. Tip Expressions are used almost everywhere and they can range from just a simple literal value to a more complex expressions using local and global variables. In the exec phase we have two components image and keyboard . First component will display the given image, and the second will wait for the user input. The image component has file defined as variable string created by interpolating direction and category values from the current trial. All strings support powerful templating provided by the Jinja template engine . keyboard component has two parameters: valid - a list of valid keys, and correct - what is considered a correct response. Notice that we have defined valid keys and correct response in abstract terms representing directions. pyFlies tries to capture the essence of the test and thus parameters and variables are defined in abstract terms. The detailed mapping is provided by the code generator and the default mappings can be overriden by the target configuration At the end we specify what will happen in correct and error phases of the trial. We choose to show green or red circle but we could also choose to play sounds, or we could leave these phases out if we don't want it. Remember that correct and error are just boolean variables that are true during phase calculation.

This is done to make generator development easier as otherwise compiler would need to translate all expressions to the target language expressions. This is an implementation detail that might change in the future.","title":"Randomization"},{"location":"about/contributing/","text":"pyFlies is open for contributions. You can contribute code, documentation, tests, bug reports. If you plan to make a contribution it would be great if you first announce that on the discussion forum. For bug reports please use github issue tracker . For code/doc/test contributions do the following: Fork the project on github . Clone your fork. Make a branch for the new feature and switch to it. Make one or more commits. Push your branch to github. Make a pull request. I will look at the changes and if everything is ok I will pull it in. Note For code contributions please try to adhere to the PEP-8 guidelines . Although we are not strict in that regard it is useful to have a common ground for coding style.
